
I have resued the Code from Assignment-2. So The main code structure is same as below. I have added a new JavaScript file named MyScript.js.

Ayesha's Nail Art Website

This website contains the HTML and CSS code for a fictional nail art website. The website has four pages: Home, Services, Blog, and Contact Us.

Files
   MyScript.js:  It implement the following function:
	Background Image Shake Animation
        This code creates a shake animation effect for an image with the ID "backgroundimage1" on mouseover. The animation is turned off, then immediately turned on with an infinite loop of         a shake animation.

     	Color Schemes for the Body
	This code allows the user to change the background and text color of the body using the setScheme() function. The function takes a string parameter with three possible values: 		"scheme1", "scheme2", or "scheme3". Each scheme changes the background and text color in a unique way.

	Contact Form
	This code allows the user to submit a form with a name and a message. On submit, the user is alerted with a message containing their name and message.

	Typewriter Text Effect
	This code creates a typewriter effect for a text element with the ID "num1". The text starts off blank and is slowly revealed as if it is being typed.

	Navigation Bar Glow Effect
	This code adds a glow effect to a navigation bar with the ID "navbar" on mouseover. The effect is created using the boxShadow CSS property.

	Slideshow Image Gallery
	This code creates a slideshow effect for a container element with the ID "imageWrapper". The images in the container move to the left every 3 seconds to create a slideshow effect.

	To use any of these functionalities on a webpage, the relevant code can be copied and pasted into the webpage's JavaScript file or embedded in a script tag in the HTML file.
